# Flopperam Unreal Engine MCP — Overview

This MCP server controls a **live Unreal Editor** instance over WebSocket. Every tool operates on the running editor — if a tool returns a connection error, the editor may not be running or the FlopAI plugin is not loaded.

## Intent Classification

Before calling any tool, classify what the user needs:

- **Question / explanation** — Answer from knowledge. Use read-only tools only if specifics are needed. Do NOT make changes.
- **Inspection / analysis** — Use read-only tools and report findings. Do NOT modify anything.
- **Modification / creation** — Proceed with the full observe → execute → verify workflow.

When intent is unclear, default to answering rather than modifying.

## Tool Categories

### Scene & Level
- `scene_query` — find actors by class/label/tag/folder with spatial filters (near/box/frustum)
- `scene_brief` — compact level overview
- `scene_compose` — declaratively spawn/modify/delete actors with prefabs + patterns
- `actor_inspect` — drill into one actor found via scene_query
- `level_inspect` — persistent level + streaming + World Partition + data layers
- `search_assets` — search Content Browser by name/prefix/class
- `asset_references` — hard-reference graphs (what does X pull in, or what uses X)
- `project_context` — engine version, enabled plugins, project settings, maps, content stats

### Blueprint (Read-Only — All Tiers)
- `bp_brief` — compact one-call BP overview. Use FIRST for orientation.
- `bp_inspect` — 21 targeted query operations batched in one call
- `bp_export` — full GraphSpec JSON dump for cloning/diffing

### Blueprint Authoring (Paid Tier)
- `bp_create` — create Actor/Pawn/Character/Component/Object/Interface/Enum/Struct BPs
- `bp_class` — reparent, add/remove interfaces, override functions, set CDO properties
- `bp_variable` — batched variable CRUD with full type vocabulary
- `bp_component` — batched component CRUD with inline property writes
- `bp_graph` — function/macro/event graph CRUD
- `bp_nodes` — batched node add/remove (~40 node types)
- `bp_wire` — batched exec + data edges + pin defaults + pin ops
- `bp_input` — Enhanced Input bundle (IA + IMC + key mappings)
- `bp_commit` — compile + auto-layout + health report

- `foliage_edit` — scatter, place exact transforms, remove by radius/type

### Cinematics & Audio
- `sequencer_edit` — Level Sequences with actor bindings, tracks, keyframes, camera cuts
- `metasound_edit` — procedural audio (MetaSound graphs)
- `sound_asset_edit` — SoundCue graphs, SoundClass, Attenuation

### Procedural
- `pcg_graph_edit` — PCG graphs with generators, samplers, filters, mesh spawners

### Data Assets
- `asset_factory` — enums/structs/DataTables/DataAssets/Enhanced Input

### Other
- `ramp_authoring` — curve assets (UCurveFloat, UCurveVector, UCurveLinearColor)
- `collision_profile_edit` — collision profiles, physical materials, object type responses

### Editor & Diagnostics
- `editor_actions` — save, undo, redo, select, build lighting, compile, PIE start/stop
- `editor_log` — Output Log + Message Log with filters
- `performance_audit` — triangle counts, actor counts, texture memory, optimization warnings
- `window_capture` — viewport screenshot as PNG
- `cpp_source` — read/write/search C++ source, Live Coding hot-reload

### Runtime Verification
- `pie_test_bp` — Blueprint-focused PIE harness with 30+ assertion types (paid)
- `pie_test_scene` — scene-focused PIE harness (free)

### Execution (Paid Tier)
- `python_execution` — arbitrary Python inside the editor process (last resort)
- `unreal_api` — 15,000+ UE API signature lookups
- `skills` / `bp_skills` — load workflow documentation on demand

## Core Workflow

1. **Orient** — `bp_brief`, `scene_brief`, `search_assets`, or `project_context`
2. **Execute** — use the appropriate domain tools
3. **Verify** — re-read with inspect tools, run PIE test for runtime behavior

## Efficiency Rules

- **Batch everything** — every tool that accepts arrays (`queries`, `variables`, `components`, `nodes`, `edges`, `operations`) is designed for one call with many items
- **Call independent tools in parallel** — don't wait for scene_query before calling search_assets if both are needed
- **Use filters** — `bp_inspect`, `material_inspect`, `widget_inspect`, `animation_inspect` all support compact mode + filters
- **Defer compile** — narrow bp_* writes defer compile; batch many, then `bp_commit` once

## Constraints

- Responses are capped at 512KB — use filters and targeted queries
- `search_assets` returns Content Browser paths in `PackageName.AssetName` format — always use the FULL path as returned
- `scene_query` returns actor labels — these are NOT asset paths
- Guessed `/Game/...` paths silently resolve to nullptr — always resolve via `search_assets` first
